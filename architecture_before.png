Elements:

1. User Browser:  
   - Requests pages like login, dashboard, event details.  
   - Receives HTML rendered by Flask templates.

2. Flask App (app.py):  
   - Handles routing, business logic, user authentication.  
   - Interacts with MySQL to read/write event, attendee, venue data.  
   - Renders templates with dynamic content.

3. MySQL Database:  
   - Stores all persistent data: users, events, attendees, venues, tasks, etc.  
   - Schema created by ems.sql.

Communication Flow:  
- User sends HTTP requests to Flask app.  
- Flask queries MySQL for data.  
- Flask renders HTML templates with data and responds to user.  
- User interacts with the system via browser interface.
