# Integration Plan: Mastodon Advertising & VR Data Output

## 1. Mastodon Advertising Integration
- Research Mastodon API endpoints for posting statuses and managing bots.
- Design a Python service that automatically posts event advertisements on the Mastodon server.
- Plan for simulating attendee reactions by generating fake tweets after events.
- Define interaction points: Flask app triggers posts when events are created or updated.

## 2. VR Data Output Integration
- Coordinate with Hermanto on expected data formats (JSON/XML/REST API).
- Plan to expose an API endpoint from the Flask app providing event details for VR consumption.
- Include event metadata such as event name, time, location, and attendee count.
- Ensure API is extensible for future features like NPC attendance and storyline triggers.

## 3. Architectural Considerations
- Use Docker containers to isolate Mastodon integration service.
- Ensure security and data validation between Flask app, Mastodon, and VR endpoints.
- Document APIs clearly for future developers.
